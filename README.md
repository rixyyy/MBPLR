## Installation
`git clone https://github.com/rixyyy/MBPLR.git`  
  
This repository is based on PyTorch 1.13.0, CUDA 11.7 and Python 3.9.19. All experiments in our paper were conducted on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU with an identical experimental setting. 
  
```conda create -n MBPLR python=3.9.19```  
`conda activate MBPLR`  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Data
Data could be got at [LA](https://github.com/yulequan/UA-MT/tree/master/data) and [ACDC](https://github.com/HiLab-git/SSL4MIS/tree/master/data/ACDC).

## Usage
To train a model,
  - `python ./code/ACDC_BCP_train.py`   
  - `python ./code/LA_BCP_train.py`
To test a model,
`python ./code/test_ACDC.py`    
`python ./code/test_LA.py`

## Acknowledgements
Our code is largely based on [BCP](https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/BCP). Thanks for these authors for their valuable work, hope our work can also contribute to related research.
